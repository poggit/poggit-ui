# UI Rewrite

This directory serves as the development for the new poggit UI that can either be injected back into the tangled poggit source code
or in the very far future be the face of a new 'core' / 'internal' poggit.

# Static Server

Using a simple no-modules required nodejs static server to server files.

`node server/index.js port<default:8080>`

Example Usage:
